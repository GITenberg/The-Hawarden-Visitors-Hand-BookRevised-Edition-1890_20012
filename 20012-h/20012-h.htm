5</span>Hawarden Village and Manor.</h2>
<p>Hawarden, in Flintshire, lies 6 miles West of Chester, at a 
height of 250 feet, overlooking a large tract of Cheshire and the
Estuary of the Dee.&nbsp; It is now in direct communication with 
the Railway world by the opening of the Hawarden and Wirral 
lines.&nbsp; It is also easily reached from Sandycroft Station, 
or from Queen&rsquo;s Ferry, (1&frac12; m.)&mdash;whence the 
Church is plainly seen&mdash;or again from Broughton Hall Station
(2&frac14;m.).&nbsp; The Glynne Arms offers plain but comfortable
accommodation.&nbsp; There are also some smaller hostelries, and 
a Coffee House called &ldquo;The Welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Village consists of a single street, about half a mile in 
length.&nbsp; Two Crosses formerly stood in it; the Upper and the
Lower, destroyed in 1641.&nbsp; The site of the Lower Cross, at 
the eastern end, is marked by a Lime tree planted in 1742.&nbsp; 
Here stood the Parish Stocks, long since perished.&nbsp; More 
durable, but grotesque in its affectation of Grecian 
architecture, may be seen close by, the old House of 
Correction.&nbsp; This spot is still called the Cross Tree.</p>
<p>The Fountain opposite the Glynne Arms is designed as a 
Memorial of the Golden Wedding of the Right Hon. W. E. and Mrs. 
Gladstone.&nbsp; A little lower down is the new Police Office; 
and further on is the Institute, containing mineralogical and 
other specimens, together with a good popular library.</p>
<p>In Doomsday Book, Hawarden appears as a Lordship, with a 
church, two ploughlands&mdash;half of one belonging to the 
church&mdash;half an acre of meadow, a wood two leagues long and 
half a league broad.&nbsp; The whole was valued at 40 shillings; 
yet on all this were but four villeyns, six boors, <!-- page 
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and four
slaves: so low was the state of population.&nbsp; It was a chief 
manor, and the capital one of the Hundred of Atiscross, extending
from the Dee to the Vale of Clwyd, and forming part of 
Cheshire.</p>
<p>The name is variously spelt in the old records.&nbsp; In 
Doomsday Book it is Haordine; elsewhere it is Weorden or 
Haweorden, Harden, HaWordin, Hauwerthyn, Hawardin and 
Hawardine.&nbsp; It is pretty clearly derived from the Welsh 
<i>Din</i> or <i>Dinas</i>, castle on a hill (although some 
attribute to it a Saxon derivation), and was no doubt, like the 
mound called Truman&rsquo;s Hill, west of the church, in the 
earliest times a British fortification.</p>
<p>No Welsh is spoken in Hawarden.&nbsp; By the construction of 
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke about A.D. 790, stretching from the Dee to the 
Wye and passing westwards of Hawarden, the place came into the 
Kingdom of Mercia, and at the time of the Invasion from Normandy 
is found in the possession of the gallant Edwin.&nbsp; It would 
appear, however, from the following story, derived, according to 
Willett&rsquo;s History of Hawarden, from a Saxon MS., that in 
the tenth century the Welsh were in possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the sixth year of the reign of Conan, King of North 
Wales, there was in the Christian Temple at a place called 
Harden, in the Kingdom of North Wales, a Roodloft, in which was 
placed an image of the Virgin Mary, with a very large cross, 
which was in the hands of the image, called Holy Rood.&nbsp; 
About this time there happened a very hot and dry summer; so dry 
that there was not grass for the cattle; upon which most of the 
inhabitants went and prayed to the image or Holy Rood, that it 
would cause it to rain, but to no purpose.&nbsp; Among the rest, 
the Lady Trawst (whose husband&rsquo;s name was Sytsylht, a 
nobleman <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and governor of Harden Castle) went to
pray to the said Holy Rood, and she praying earnestly and long, 
the image or Holy Rood fell down upon her head and killed her; 
upon which a great uproar was raised, and it was concluded and 
resolved upon to try the said image for the murder of the said 
Lady Trawst, and a jury was summoned for this purpose, whose 
names were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hincot of Hancot, Span of Mancot,<br />
Leech and Leach, and Cumberbeach.<br />
Peet and Pate, with Corbin of the gate,<br />
Milling and Hughet, with Gill and Pughet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jury&mdash;so continues the story&mdash;found the Holy 
Rood guilty of wilful murder, and the sentence was proposed that 
she should be hanged.&nbsp; This was opposed by Span, who 
suggested that, as they wanted rain, it would be best to drown 
her.&nbsp; This, again, was objected to by Corbin, who advised to
lay her on the sands of the river and see what became of 
her.&nbsp; This was done, with the result that the image was 
carried by the tide to some low land near the wall of 
Caerleon&mdash;(supposed to be Chester)&mdash;where it was found 
by the Cestrians drowned and dead, and by them buried at the gate
where found, with this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Jews their God did crucify,<br />
The Hardeners theirs did drown,<br />
&rsquo;Cos, with their wants she&rsquo;d not comply,<br />
And lies under this cold stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence the said low land, or island, as it may have been, is 
supposed to have got the name of the Rood-Eye, or Roodee as at 
present.</p>
<p>After the Conquest, Hawarden was included in the vast grant 
made by William to his kinsman, Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, 
which included Cheshire and all the seaboard as far as 
Conway.&nbsp; The Earl had his residence at Chester, and there 
held his Courts and Parliament.&nbsp; His <!-- page 8--><a 
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>sword of 
dignity, referred to in the heading of Common Law Indictments, is
preserved in the British Museum.&nbsp; Among the earliest 
residents at Hawarden occurs the name of Roger Fitzvalence, son 
of one of the Conqueror&rsquo;s followers; subsequently it 
continued in the possession of the Earls of Chester till the 
death of Ranulf de Blundeville, the last earl, in 1231, when, 
with Castle Rising and the &lsquo;Earl&rsquo;s Half&rsquo; in 
Coventry, it passed, through his sister Mabel, to her 
descendants, the Montalts.</p>
<p>The Barons de Monte Alto, sometimes styled de Moaldis or 
Mohaut (now Mold, 6 miles from Hawarden, where the mound of the 
castle remains), were hereditary seneschals of Chester and lords 
of Mold.&nbsp; Roger de Montalt inherited Hawarden, Coventry, and
Castle Rising, and married Julian, daughter of Roger de Clifford,
Justiciary of Chester and North Wales, who was captured at the 
storming of the Castle by Llewelyn, in 1281.&nbsp; Robert de 
Montalt the last lord, died childless <a name="citation8"></a><a 
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a> in 1329, when the 
barony became extinct.&nbsp; He it was who signed the celebrated 
letter to the Pope in 1300 as Dominus de Hawardyn.</p>
<p>Robert de Montalt bequeathed his estates to Isabella, Queen of
Edward II., and Hawarden afterwards passed by exchange, in 1337, 
to Sir William de Montacute, Earl of Salisbury.&nbsp; From that 
family it reverted in 1406, by attainder, to the Crown, and in 
1411 was granted by Henry IV. to his second son, Thomas, Duke of 
Clarence.&nbsp; Clarence dying without issue in 1420, it reverted
once more to the Crown, but finally, in 1454, passed to Sir 
Thomas Stanley, Comptroller of the Household and afterwards Lord 
Stanley, whose son became the first Earl of Derby.&nbsp; In 1495,
Henry VII. honoured Hawarden with a visit, and made <!-- page 
9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>some 
residence here for the amusement of stag-hunting, but his primary
motive was to soothe the Earl (husband to Margaret, the 
King&rsquo;s mother) after the ungrateful execution of his 
brother, Sir William Stanley. <a name="citation9a"></a><a 
href="#footnote9a" class="citation">[9a]</a></p>
<p>Hawarden remained in the possession of the Stanleys for nearly
200 years.&nbsp; William, the sixth Earl, when advanced in years,
surrendered the property to his son James, reserving to himself 
&pound;1000 a year, and retiring to a convenient house <a 
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b" 
class="citation">[9b]</a> near the Dee, spent there the remainder
of his life, and died in 1642.&nbsp; James, distinguished for his
learning and gallantry, warmly espoused the cause first of 
Charles I. and afterwards that of his son.&nbsp; Under his roof 
Charles, when a fugitive, halted on his way from Chester to 
Denbigh, on Sept. 25, 1645.&nbsp; After the battle of Worcester, 
in 1657, James was taken prisoner, tried by Court Martial, and 
executed at Bolton in the same year.</p>
<p>In 1653, the Lordship of Hawarden was purchased from the 
agents of sequestration by Serjeant (afterwards Chief Justice) 
Glynne; and in 1661 the sale was confirmed by Charles, Earl of 
Derby.</p>
<p>The Glynnes are first heard of at Glyn Llivon, in 
Carnarvonshire, in 1567.&nbsp; They trace their descent, however,
much further back, to Cilmin Droed Dhu (Cilmin of the Black 
Foot), who came into Wales from the North of Britain with his 
uncle Mervyn, King of the Isle of Man, who married Esyllt, 
heiress of Conan, King of North Wales, about A.D. 830.&nbsp; The 
territory allotted to him extended from Carnarvon <!-- page 
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to 
beyond Clynnog.&nbsp; Edward Llwyd was the first to assume the 
name of Glynne, which his descendants continued till the male 
succession ended in John Glynne, whose daughter and heiress, 
Frances, married Thomas Wynne of Bodnau, created a baronet in 
1742.&nbsp; His son, Sir John, is said to have pulled down the 
old strong mansion of Cilmin, and erected the present one.&nbsp; 
His son again, Sir Thomas, was created a Peer of Ireland for his 
services in the American war, whose descendant is the present 
Lord Newborough.&nbsp; The father of the Serjeant was Sir William
Glynne, Knight, 21st in descent from Cilmin Droed Dhu.&nbsp; The 
Serjeant early espoused the cause of the popular party, perhaps 
rather from ambition than from principle.&nbsp; His abilities 
were soon recognized, and while still young he became High 
Steward of Westminster and Recorder of London.&nbsp; In 1640 he 
was elected Member for Westminster as a strong 
Presbyterian.&nbsp; He was actively concerned in conducting the 
charge against Lord Strafford.&nbsp; In 1646 he opposed in 
Parliament Cromwell&rsquo;s Self-denying Ordinance, and was 
thrown into prison.&nbsp; He found means, however, to get 
reconciled to Cromwell in 1648, and became one of his Council and
Serjeant-at-law.&nbsp; In 1654 he became Chamberlain of Chester, 
and in the following year succeeded Rolle as Lord Chief 
Justice&mdash;which office he discharged with credit. <a 
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10" 
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; In 1656 he was returned for 
Carnarvonshire, and in the Rump Parliament he sat again for 
Westminster.&nbsp; Meanwhile he contrived to ingratiate himself 
with the opposite side, and in 1660 we find him assisting on 
horseback at the coronation of Charles II.&nbsp; He now resigned 
the Chief Justiceship, made himself very useful in settling legal
difficulties consequent upon the usurpation, and became as <!-- 
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>loyal as any cavalier: the King, as a mark of his 
favour, <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a" 
class="citation">[11a]</a> bestowing a baronetcy upon his son in 
1661.&nbsp; He possessed Henley Park, <a 
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b" 
class="citation">[11b]</a> in Surrey, and an estate at Bicester, 
in Oxfordshire, (of which church, as well as Ambrosden, he was 
patron) where the family resided.&nbsp; He died at his house in 
Westminster in 1666, and was buried in a vault beneath the altar 
of S. Margaret&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>His son, Sir William Glynne, the first baronet, sat in 
Parliament for Woodstock, and died in 1721.&nbsp; It was not till
1723 that the Glynnes moved to Hawarden, from Bicester.&nbsp; An 
old stone records the building of a house in Broadlane in 
1727.&nbsp; In 1732 Sir John Glynne, nephew of Sir William, 
married Honora Conway, co-heiress with her sister Catherine of 
the Ravenscrofts of Bretton and Broadlane, an old family 
connected with Hawarden for many generations. <a 
name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c" 
class="citation">[11c]</a>&nbsp; This lady was the great great 
grand-daughter of Sir Kenelm Digby, and with her one-half of the 
Ravenscroft lands came into possession of the Glynnes; the other 
half in Bretton passing eventually to the Grosvenors.&nbsp; She 
died in 1769.&nbsp; In 1752 Sir John built a new house at 
Broadlane, which has since been the residence of the family.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
12</span>Though not the founder of the <i>family</i>, Sir John 
Glynne may fairly be considered the founder of the <i>place</i>, 
and of the estate in its modern sense.&nbsp; Though he sat for 
five Parliaments for the Borough of Flint, he devoted himself 
largely to domestic concerns and to the improvement of his 
property by inclosure, drainage, and otherwise.&nbsp; The present
beauty of the Park is in a great measure due to his energy and 
foresight.&nbsp; Upon the acquisition of Broadlane Hall, he at 
once took in hand the re-planting of the demesne, <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" 
class="citation">[12]</a> first in Broadlane and about the Old 
Castle, and in 1747 on the Bilberry Hill.&nbsp; He also turned 
his attention to the developement of the minerals on the estate, 
and attempted the carriage of coals to Chester by water.&nbsp; He
died in 1777.</p>
<p>His Grandson, Sir S. R. Glynne, married in 1806 the Hon. Mary 
Neville, daughter of Lord Braybrooke and of Catherine, sister to 
George, Marquess of Buckingham, and by her had four children: 
Stephen, eighth and last Baronet, born September 22, 1807; Henry,
Rector of Hawarden born September 9th, 1810; Catherine, now Mrs. 
Gladstone, born January 6, 1812; and Mary, afterwards Lady 
Lyttelton, born July 22, 1813.&nbsp; He died in 1815 at the age 
of 35 years, and of his children Mrs. Gladstone alone 
survives.&nbsp; Sir Stephen, the last Baronet, died unmarried in 
1874, surviving his brother the Rector only two years; and the 
Lordship of the Manor, together, by a family arrangement, with 
the estates, then devolved upon the present owner.</p>

<h2><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>The Old Castle.</h2>
<p>The Ruins of Hawarden Castle occupy a lofty eminence, guarded 
on the S. by a steep ravine, and on the other sides by artificial
banks and ditches, partly favoured by the formation of the 
ground.&nbsp; The space so occupied measures about 150 yards in 
diameter.&nbsp; Upon the summit stands the Keep, towering some 50
feet above the main ward, and some 200 feet above the bottom of 
the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place presents,&rdquo; says Mr. G. T. Clark, 
&ldquo;in a remarkable degree the features of a well-known class 
of earthworks found both in England and in Normandy.&nbsp; This 
kind of fortification by mound, bank and ditch was in use in the 
ninth, tenth, and even in the eleventh centuries, before masonry 
was general. <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13" 
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; The mound was crowned with a 
strong circular house of timber, such as in the Bayeaux tapestry 
the soldiers are attempting to set on fire.&nbsp; The Court below
and the banks beyond the ditches were fenced with palisades and 
defences of that character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was usual after the Conquest to replace these old 
fortifications with the thick and massive masonry characteristic 
of Norman Architecture.&nbsp; Hawarden, however, bears no marks 
of the Norman style though the Keep is unusually 
substantial.&nbsp; It appears, according to the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>best 
authorities, <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14" 
class="citation">[14]</a> to be the work of one period, and that,
probably, the close of the reign of Henry III. or the early part 
of that of Edward I.&nbsp; Hence Roger Fitzvalence, the first 
possessor after the Conquest, and the Montalts, who held it by 
Seneschalship to Hugh Lupus, must have been content to allow the 
old defences to remain, as any masonry constructed by them could 
scarcely have been so entirely removed as to show no trace of the
style prevalent at the time.</p>
<p>The Keep is circular, 61 feet in diameter, and originally 
about 40 feet high.&nbsp; The wall is 15 feet thick at the base, 
and 13 feet at the level of the rampart walk&mdash;dimensions of 
unusual solidity even at the Norman period, and rare indeed in 
England under Henry III. or the Edwards.&nbsp; The battlements 
have been replaced by a modern wall, but the junction with the 
old work may be readily detected.&nbsp; In the Keep were two 
floors&mdash;the lower, no doubt, a store room without fire-place
or seat&mdash;the upper a state room lighted from three recesses 
and entered from the portcullis chamber.</p>
<p>Next to this last is the Chapel, or rather <i>Sacrarium</i>, 
with a cinquefoil-headed doorway, and a small recess for a 
piscina, with a projecting bracket and fluted foot.&nbsp; Against
the West wall is a stone bench, and above it a rude squint 
through which the elevation of the Host could be seen from the 
adjoining window recess.&nbsp; Of the two windows, one is square,
the other lancet-headed.&nbsp; The altar is modern.&nbsp; There 
is a mural gallery in the thickness of the wall running round 
nearly the whole circle of the Keep, and with remarkably strong 
vaulting.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>Descending from the Keep and inclosing the space below, 
were two walls or curtains, as they are technically called.&nbsp;
That on the N. side, 7 feet thick and 25 feet high, is still 
tolerably perfect, and within it lay the way between the Keep and
the main ward.&nbsp; Of the South curtain only a fragment remains
attached to the Keep.</p>
<p>The entrance to the court-yard&mdash;now the so-called 
bowling-green&mdash;was on the N. side.&nbsp; On the South side, 
on the first floor (the basement being probably a cellar), was 
the Hall, 30 feet high from its timber floor to the wall 
plate.&nbsp; Two lofty windows remain and traces of a third, and 
between them are the plain chamfered corbel whence sprung the 
open roof.&nbsp; Below the hall is seen a small <i>ambry</i> or 
cupboard in the wall.</p>
<p>Outside the curtain on the East side, where the visitor 
ascends to the Courtyard, are remains of a kitchen and other 
offices with apartments over, resting upon the scarp of the 
ditch.</p>
<p>From the N.E. angle of the curtain projects a spur work 
protected by two curtains, one of which, 4 feet thick and 24 feet
high, only remains, with a shouldered postern door opening on the
scarp of the ditch at its junction with the main curtain.&nbsp; 
This spur work was the entrance to the Castle, and contains a 
deep pit, now called the Dungeon, and a Barbican or Sally-port 
beyond.&nbsp; The pit is 12 feet deep and measures 27 feet x 10 
feet across.&nbsp; It may possibly have served the double purpose
of defence and of water supply&mdash;there being no other 
apparent source.&nbsp; In the footbridge across the pit may have 
been a trap-door, or other means for suddenly breaking 
communication in case of need.&nbsp; Overhead probably lay the 
roadway for horsemen with a proper drawbridge.&nbsp; The 
thickness of the <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>walls indicates their having been 
built to a considerable height, sufficient probably to form 
parapets masking the passage of the bridge.</p>
<p>In the mound beyond, or counterscarp, was the gate-house and 
Barbican, containing a curious fan-shaped chamber up a flight of 
steps.&nbsp; While the earth-works surrounding the Castle are the
oldest part of the fortifications&mdash;possibly, thinks Mr. 
Clark, of the tenth century&mdash;the dressed masonry and the 
different material of the Barbican and Dungeon-pit, together with
some of the exterior offices, show them to be of somewhat later 
date than the main building.&nbsp; They have, in fact, as Mr. 
Clark remarks, more of an unfinished than a partially destroyed 
appearance.&nbsp; The squared and jointed stones, so easily 
removable and ready to hand, <a name="citation16"></a><a 
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> proved no doubt a 
tempting quarry to subsequent owners of Hawarden, who perhaps 
shared the faults of a period when neither the architectural nor 
historical value of ancient remains was generally 
appreciated.</p>
<p>It now remains to trace the history of the Castle, so far as 
it is known to us.</p>
<p>In 1264 a memorable conference took place within its walls 
between Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and Llewelyn, 
Prince of North Wales, at which each promised to aid the other in
promoting the execution of their respective plans.&nbsp; The 
King, who, with the Prince of Wales, was the Earl&rsquo;s 
prisoner, was compelled <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to renounce his rights, and the 
Castle was given up to Llewelyn.&nbsp; On the suppression of de 
Montfort&rsquo;s rebellion the Castle reverted to the Crown, and 
Llewelyn was called upon by the Papal Legate, Ottoboni, to 
surrender it.&nbsp; This he at first declined, but being deserted
by the Earl, who at the same time, in order to put an end to the 
conflict, offered to him his daughter Eleanor in marriage agreed 
afterwards to a treaty by which the Castle was to be destroyed, 
and Robert de Montalt to be reinstated in the possession of his 
lands in Hawarden, but to be restrained from restoring the 
fortification for thirty years.</p>
<p>This stipulation appears to have been violated, for in 1281 
the Welsh rebelled, and under David and Llewelyn (who then made 
up their quarrel), an attack was made by night upon the Castle, 
then styled Castrum Regis, which was successful.&nbsp; Roger de 
Clifford, Justiciary of Chester, was taken prisoner, and the 
Castle with much bloodshed and cruelty stormed and partly burnt 
on Palm Sunday.&nbsp; The outrage was repeated in the next year 
(Nov. 6th, 1282), when the Justice&rsquo;s elder son, also Roger 
Clifford, was slain.&nbsp; Soon after this Llewelyn died, Wales 
was entirely subjugated, and David executed as a traitor.</p>
<p>To this period may most probably be assigned the present 
structure.&nbsp; A Keep, such as that now standing is not likely 
to have been successfully assaulted in two successive years; nor 
does internal evidence favour the idea that it was the actual 
work taken by the Welsh.&nbsp; Robert, the last of the Montalts, 
was a wealthy man, and in all probability it was during his 
Lordship, between 1297 and 1329, that the Castle, as we now see 
it, was built.&nbsp; Though the unusual thickness of the walls of
the Keep might be thought more in keeping with the Norman period,
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>the general details, as already stated, the polygonal 
mural gallery and interior, and the entrance, evidently parts of 
the original work, are very decidedly Edwardian.</p>
<p>Of the subsequent history of the Castle, we have unfortunately
nothing to record until we come to the Civil War between Charles 
the First and the Parliament.&nbsp; On Nov. 11th, 1643, Sir 
William Brereton, who had declared for the Parliament, appeared 
with his adherents at Hawarden Castle, where he was welcomed by 
Robert Ravenscroft and John Aldersey, who had charge of it in the
name of the King.&nbsp; Sir William established himself in the 
Castle, and harassed the garrison of Chester, which was for the 
King, by cutting off the supplies of coals, corn and other 
provisions, which they had formerly drawn from the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Archbishop of York, writing 
from Conway to the Duke of Ormond announced the betrayal of the 
Castle and appealed for assistance.&nbsp; In response to this a 
force from Ireland was landed at Mostyn in the same month, and 
employed to reduce the fortress, garrisoned by 120 men of Sir 
Thomas Middleton&rsquo;s Regiment.&nbsp; The garrison received by
a trumpet a verbal summons to surrender, which gave occasion to a
correspondence, followed by a further and more peremptory summons
from Captain Thomas Sandford, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Gentlemen: I presume you very well know or have 
heard of my condition and disposition; and that I neither give 
nor take quarter.&nbsp; I am now with my Firelocks (who never yet
neglected opportunity to correct rebels) ready to use you as I 
have done the Irish; but loth I am to spill my countrymen&rsquo;s
blood: wherefore by these I advise you to your fealty and 
obedience towards his Majesty; and show yourselves faithful 
subjects, by delivering the Castle into my hands for His 
Majesty&rsquo;s use&mdash;otherwise if you put me to the least 
trouble or loss of blood to force you, expect no quarter <!-- 
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>for man woman or child.&nbsp; I hear you have some of 
our late Irish army in your company: they very well know me and 
that my Firelocks use not to parley.&nbsp; Be not unadvised, but 
think of your liberty, for I vow all hopes of relief are taken 
from you; and our intents are not to starve you but to batter and
storm you and then hang you all, and follow the rest of that 
rebellious crewe.&nbsp; I am no bread-and-cheese rogue, but as 
ever a Loyalist, and will ever be while I can write or name</p>
<p style="text-align: right">THOMAS SANDFORD,<br />
Nov, 28, 1643.&nbsp; Captain of Firelocks.</p>
<p>I expect your speedy answer this Tuesday night at Broadlane 
Hall, where I am now, your near neighbour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reinforcements having arrived from Chester, this was followed 
by a brisk attack on the 3rd December, whereupon the garrison 
being short of provisions, a white flag was hung out from the 
walls, and the Castle surrendered on the following day to Sir 
Michael Emley.&nbsp; It was held by the Royalists for two years, 
but after the surrender of Chester, in Feb. 1646, Sir William 
Neal, the governor, capitulated (after receiving the King&rsquo;s
sanction&mdash;then at Oxford&mdash;) to Major-General Mytton 
after a month&rsquo;s siege.&nbsp; It was probably during these 
operations that the specimens of stone and iron cannon balls 
still remaining were used.</p>
<p>An entry in the Commons&rsquo; Journals refers to this last 
event, dated 16th March, 1645.</p>
<p>Ordered: That Mr. Fogge the Minister shall have the sum of 
&pound;50 bestowed upon him for his pains in bringing the good 
news of the taking of the Castle of Hawarden; and that the 
Committee of Lords and Commons for advance of Moneys at 
Haberdashers&rsquo; Hall do pay the same accordingly.</p>
<p>The Lords&rsquo; concurrence to be desired herein.</p>
<p>In the following year there is an Order &ldquo;That the 
Castles of Hawarden, Flint, and Ruthland be disgarrisoned <!-- 
page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
20</span>and demolished, all but a tower in Flint Castle, to be 
reserved for a gaol for the County&rdquo;; and a confirmation of 
it follows in the next year, dated 19th July, 1647.</p>
<p>These orders were no doubt forthwith executed, and of Flint 
and Rhuddlan little now remains.&nbsp; At Hawarden gunpowder has 
been used to blow up portions of the Keep.&nbsp; Sir William 
Glynne, son of the Chief Justice, twenty or thirty years later, 
carried further the work of destruction.&nbsp; Sir John Glynne, 
too, is said to have made free with the materials of the Castle, 
and certain it is that a vast amount has been carted away and 
used up in walls and for other purposes.&nbsp; His successors, 
however, have done their utmost to make amends for these ravages,
and to preserve the ruins from further injury.&nbsp; The entrance
and the winding stair by which the visitor mounts to the top of 
the Keep are a restoration skilfully effected not long ago under 
the direction of Mr. Shaw of Saddleworth.&nbsp; The view embraces
a wide range of country, North, East, and South, extending from 
Liverpool to the Wrekin: on the West it is bounded by Moel Fammau
or Queen Mountain, on the summit of which is seen the remnant of 
the fallen obelisk raised to commemorate the 50th year of the 
reign of George III.&nbsp; Round about lie the Woods and the 
Park, presenting a happy mixture of wild and pastoral beauty; 
while close beneath the Old stands the New Castle, affecting in 
its turreted outline some degree of congruity with its prototype,
but much more contrasting with it in its home-like air, and the 
luxury of its lawns and flower-beds.</p>
<p>Not less striking is the view of the Ruins from below.&nbsp; 
Here judgment and taste have combined with great natural 
advantages of position to produce an exceedingly picturesque 
effect.&nbsp; From the flower garden a wide sweep <!-- page 
21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of 
lawn, flanked by majestic oaks and beeches, carries the eye up to
the foot-bridge crossing the moat, thence to the ivy-mantled 
walls which overhang it, and upward again to the flag-topt tower 
that crowns the height.&nbsp; Clusters of ivy, and foliage here 
and there intervening, serve to soften and beautify the 
mouldering remains.&nbsp; The scene brings to our minds the words
of the poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The old order changeth, yielding place to 
new&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and, conscious as we may be that society in our day has its 
dangers and disorders of a different and more insidious kind, we 
are thankful that our lot is not cast in the harsh and troublous 
times of our history.&nbsp; All around us the former scenes of 
rapine and violence are changed to fertility and peace.&nbsp; The
Old Castle serves well to illustrate the contrast.&nbsp; Its 
hugely solid walls, reared 600 years ago with so much pains and 
skill to repel the invader and to overawe the lawless, have 
played their part, and are themselves abandoned to solitude and 
decay.&nbsp; Within the arches which once echoed to the clang of 
arms the owls have their home; while the rooks from the tree-tops
around seem to chant the <i>requiem</i> of the past.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Hawarden Church, with its large graveyard attached, finely 
situated overlooking the estuary of the Dee, is supposed to have 
been built about A.D. 1275, and has much solidity and dignity of 
structure.&nbsp; The patron saint is S. Deiniol, founder of the 
Collegiate monastery at Bangor, and about A.D. 550 made first 
Bishop of that See.&nbsp; In the old records he is styled one of 
the three &ldquo;Gwynvebydd&rdquo; or holy men of the Isle of 
Britain.&nbsp; He was buried in Bardsey Island.&nbsp; A place 
still called &ldquo;Daniel&rsquo;s Ash&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps a 
corruption of Deiniol&mdash;may be the very spot where he <!-- 
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>gathered his disciples round him.&nbsp; Two Dedication 
festivals are observed, the one on S. Deiniol&rsquo;s Day, 
December 10th, the other on the Sunday after Holy Cross Day, 
September 14th.&nbsp; The Church has a central tower containing 
six bells, <a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a" 
class="citation">[23a]</a> a chancel with a south aisle called 
the Whitley Chancel (after the Whitleys of Aston), and a nave 
with blind clerestory and two aisles.&nbsp; There is a division 
in the roof between the chancel and the nave which has the 
appearance of a transept, but not extended beyond the line of the
aisles.&nbsp; The axis of the chancel deviates from that of the 
nave.</p>
<p>In 1764 the nave and aisles were newly pewed in place of the 
old benches, and the floor flagged instead of being strewn with 
rushes.&nbsp; In 1810 a gallery was erected at the west end and 
an organ placed in it; the gallery was enlarged and a new organ 
purchased in 1836. <a name="citation23b"></a><a 
href="#footnote23b" class="citation">[23b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>Great improvements were made about the year 1855 by the 
Rev. Henry Glynne, Rector: the organ and singers were removed 
from the west to the east end, the pews converted into open 
seats, and the cumbrous &ldquo;three decker&rdquo; pulpit and 
reading desk <a name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a" 
class="citation">[24a]</a> exchanged for simpler furniture.&nbsp;
Unfortunately on the 29th October, 1857, a disastrous fire 
occurred, almost entirely destroying the roof and fittings of the
Church.&nbsp; Its restoration was at once placed in the hands of 
Sir Gilbert Scott, architect, who improved the occasion by adding
the small spire which now with excellent effect crowns the 
otherwise somewhat stunted tower.&nbsp; An organ chamber was now 
added on the N. side of the chancel, and on the 14th July, 1859, 
with Sermons from the late Bishop Wilberforce, Dean Hook and 
others, the Church was re-opened.&nbsp; The whole expenditure was
about &pound;8000.</p>
<p>The Reredos is a representation of the Last Supper in 
alabaster, and was erected as a memorial to the Rev. Henry 
Glynne, Rector of the Parish for 38 years.&nbsp; In the side 
chancel <a name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b" 
class="citation">[24b]</a> under the &lsquo;Vine&rsquo; window, 
is a recumbent figure of his brother, Sir Stephen Glynne, who 
died two years later in 1874&mdash;a beautiful work by 
Noble.&nbsp; To his memory also were given by the parishioners 
the wrought-iron gates at the main entrance to the 
Churchyard.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>Upon the altar table stands a handsome brass cross 
mounted on <i>rosso antico</i> the gift of the parishioners to 
the present Rector.&nbsp; The old Communion plate was twice 
stolen, viz., on April 13th, 1821, when it was recovered, being 
found beaten flat and buried near the Higher Ferry; and finally 
in 1859.&nbsp; The Churchyard was enlarged in 1859, by gift of 
the late Rector.&nbsp; The old Cross which stood in the 
Churchyard in 1663, has disappeared: possibly the Sun-dial now 
occupies its place.</p>
<p>The Parish Register dates from the year 1585; and the list of 
Rectors goes back to 1180.</p>
<p>The Living is what is termed &lsquo;a Peculiar,&rsquo; and was
formerly exempt from Episcopal jurisdiction.&nbsp; The Rectors 
granted marriage licenses, proved wills, and had their own 
consistorial Courts and Proctors.&nbsp; The Court was held in the
Eastern Bay of the Chancel Aisle: the seal, still used, 
represents Daniel in the Lion&rsquo;s Den, with the legend 
&lsquo;Sigillum peculiaris et exempt&aelig; jurisdictionis de 
Hawarden&rsquo;.&nbsp; These privileges, originally granted by 
the Pope, were continued at the Reformation; but in 1849 the 
Parish was definitely attached to the Diocese of S. Asaph, and 
the power of granting marriage licenses now alone remains.</p>
<p>The Tithes were in 1093, granted by Hugh Lupus, Earl of 
Chester, to the Monks of S. Werburgh.&nbsp; In 1288 Pope Nicholas
the 3rd, granted them to King Edward the 1st, for six 
years.&nbsp; They were then valued at &pound;13 6s. 8d.&nbsp; At 
the Reformation they were estimated at &pound;66 6s. 
5&frac12;d.</p>
<p>The Rectory was greatly enlarged by the Hon. George Neville 
Grenville, Rector from 1814 to 1834, and afterwards Dean of 
Windsor.&nbsp; The garden comprises nearly six acres and is 
charmingly laid out.</p>

27</span>The Modern Residence and Park.</h2>
<p>The modern Residence was built in 1752 upon the site of 
Broadlane Hall, the seat of the Ravenscrofts, an old house of 
wood and plaster, which came into Sir John Glynne&rsquo;s 
possession by his marriage with Honora Conway, daughter of Henry 
Conway and Honora Ravenscroft.&nbsp; Originally a square brick 
house, it was afterwards in 1809 extended by the addition of the 
Library on the West side and of the Kitchen and other offices on 
the East; the whole being cased in stone <a 
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" 
class="citation">[27]</a> and castellated.&nbsp; The entrance was
now turned from the S. to the N. front&mdash;the turnpike road, 
which passed in front of the house and along the Moat to the 
Village, having been diverted in 1804&mdash;and the present 
Flower-garden constructed with the old Thorn-tree in the 
centre.&nbsp; Quite recently has been added the block at the N.W.
angle of the house, containing Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Study, or, 
as he calls it, the &lsquo;Temple of Peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>The most striking feature about this room is that (to use the 
phrase of a writer in Harper&rsquo;s Magazine) it is built about 
with bookcases.&nbsp; Instead of being ranged along the wall in 
the usual way, they stand out into the room at right angles, each
wide enough to hold a double row facing either way.&nbsp; 
Intervals are left sufficient to give access to the books, and 
Mr. Gladstone prides himself upon the economy of space obtained 
by this arrangement.&nbsp; His Library numbers near 20,000 
volumes, many of which have overflowed into adjoining rooms, 
where they are similarly stored.&nbsp; <!-- page 28--><a 
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Of this 
number Theology claims a large proportion; Homer, Dante, <a 
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a" 
class="citation">[28a]</a> and Shakespeare also have their 
respective departments, and any resident visitor is at liberty, 
on entering his or her name in a book kept for the purpose, to 
borrow any volume at pleasure.&nbsp; Three writing-tables are 
seen.&nbsp; At one Mr. Gladstone sits when busy in political work
and correspondence; the second is reserved for literary and 
especially, Homeric studies; the third is Mrs. 
Gladstone&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; remarked Mr. 
Gladstone to the writer above mentioned, with a wistful glance at
the table where &lsquo;Vaticanism&rsquo; and &lsquo;Juventus 
Mundi&rsquo; were written, &ldquo;A long time since I sat 
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the room are to be seen busts and 
photographs of old friends and colleagues&mdash;Sidney Herbert, 
the Duke of Newcastle, Canning, Tennyson, Lord Richard Cavendish,
and others, while in the corners lurk numerous walking sticks and
axes.</p>
<p>Adjoining Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s room is the Library of the 
house&mdash;a well-proportioned and comfortable room, well stored
with books, prominent among which topography and ecclesiology 
testify to the predelictions of the late owner, Sir Stephen 
Glynne. <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b" 
class="citation">[28b]</a>&nbsp; There are some good family 
portraits and other pictures, among which are specimens of Sir 
Peter Lely, Snyders, and a very fine likeness of Sir Kenelm Digby
by Vandyke.&nbsp; There is a fine picture by <!-- page 29--><a 
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Millais of 
Mr. Gladstone and his grandson, <a name="citation29a"></a><a 
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a> painted in 1889, 
and another good portrait of him by the late F. Holl; also a 
much-admired likeness of Mrs. Gladstone by Herkomer.</p>
<p>Shading the windows of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Study is a 
singular circle of limes of some 20 feet in diameter, which goes 
by the name of Sir John Glynne&rsquo;s Dressing-Room.&nbsp; 
Mounting the slope towards the old castle is the Broad Walk, 
terminating in an artificial amphitheatre at the top, made by Sir
John Glynne to give employment in a time of distress.&nbsp; The 
grounds abound in fine trees, <a name="citation29b"></a><a 
href="#footnote29b" class="citation">[29b]</a> and in 
rhododendrons which in spring form masses of bloom.</p>
<p>In 1819, Prince Leopold, the late King of the Belgians, 
visited the Castle; and the small wooden door on the south side 
of the Ruins is still called after him.&nbsp; The Visitors&rsquo;
Book at the Lodge also records, in autograph, the names of Her 
Gracious Majesty, as Princess Victoria, and her mother, the 
Duchess of Kent, in or about the year 1833.</p>
<p>In the palmy days of the Royal British Bowmen the Castle was 
the frequent scene of bow-meetings; the peculiar green costumes 
and feathers worn by both the ladies and gentlemen competitors 
contributing to the picturesque effect of these gatherings.&nbsp;
Simultaneously with one of these Archery Meetings, in the year, 
we believe, 1835, was held a Fancy Bazaar, commemorated in some 
admirable lines by Mr. R. E. Warburton of Arley Hall, which will 
be read with pleasure in connection with more recent bazaars held
in the same place.</p>

Mrs. Gladstone&rsquo;s Orphanage, containing from 20 to 30 
boys.&nbsp; Close by is a little Home of Rest established by Mrs.
Gladstone, for old and infirm women.&nbsp; The house in which the
orphans are lodged is called Diglane, and was formerly the 
residence of the Crachley family.&nbsp; It was sold to Sir John 
Glynne in 1749.</p>

<p>The Park is about 250 acres in extent, to which have to be 
added the Bilberry Wood and Warren Plantations.&nbsp; It is 
divided into two parts by a ravine passing immediately under the 
old Castle and traversing its entire length.&nbsp; The further 
side is called the Deer Park, inclosed and stocked by Sir John 
Glynne in 1739.&nbsp; Its banks and glades, richly timbered, and 
overgrown with bracken, afford from various points beautiful 
views over the plain of Chester, with the bold projections of the
Frodsham and Peckforton hills.&nbsp; Along the bottom of the 
hollow flows Broughton brook.&nbsp; Two Waterfalls occur in its 
course through the Park: the lower is called the Ladies&rsquo; 
Fall: near the upper one stood a Mill, now removed, the erection 
of which is commemorated by a large stone, bearing the following 
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Trust in God for
Bread, and to the King for Justice, Protection and Peace.<br />
This Mill was built A.D. 1767<br />
By Sir John Glynne, Bart.,<br />
Lord of this Manor:<br />
Charles Howard Millwright.<br />
Wheat was at this year 9s. and Barley at 5s. 6d. a Bushel.&nbsp; 
Luxury was at a great height, and Charity extensive, but the pool
were starving, riotous, and hanged.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between this spot and the &ldquo;Old Lane,&rdquo; a sandy 
gully, lined with old beeches, and once the road to 
Wrexham&mdash;now tenanted by rabbits&mdash;are two large oaks, 
17 and 18 <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>feet in circumference 
respectively.&nbsp; Another tree, a beautiful specimen of the 
<i>fagus pendula</i>, or feathering beech, a great favourite with
Mr. Gladstone, deserves attention.&nbsp; It stands a few yards 
from the iron railing near the moat of the old Castle, and 
measures 17ft. 11 in. round.&nbsp; The sycamores at Hawarden are 
particularly fine.&nbsp; Nor should the visitor omit seeing the 
noble grove of beeches at the Ladies&rsquo; Fall.</p>
<p>The road which descends the steep hill under the Old Castle 
and crosses the brook, leads up through the Park to the Bilberry 
Wood.&nbsp; Twenty minutes&rsquo; walk through the wood brings 
one to the &ldquo;Top Lodge&rdquo; (1&frac34; miles from the 
Castle).&nbsp; From this point either the walk may be continued 
through the further plantations to the pretty Church of St. 
John&rsquo;s at Penymynydd, <a name="citation32a"></a><a 
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a> or, if necessary 
Broughton Hall Station, 2&frac12; miles distant, may be gained 
direct.&nbsp; The inclosures and the plantations on this portion 
of the estate, called the Warren, were made in 1798, and command 
some very fine views.&nbsp; The high road through Pentrobin and 
Tinkersdale offers a pleasant return route to Hawarden.</p>
<p>Everyone has heard of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s prowess as a 
woodcutter, and to some it may even have been matter of surprise 
to see no scantiness of trees in the Park at Hawarden.&nbsp; It 
is true that he attacks trees with the same vigour as he attacks 
abuses in the body politic, <a name="citation32b"></a><a 
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a> but he attacks 
them on <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the same principle&mdash;they are 
blemishes and not ornaments.&nbsp; No one more scrupulously 
respects a sound and shapely tree than Mr. Gladstone; and if he 
is prone to condemn those that show signs of decay, he is always 
ready to listen to any plea that may be advanced on their behalf 
by other members of the family.&nbsp; In this, as in other 
matters, doubtful points will of course arise; but there can be 
no question that a policy of inert conservatism is an entire 
mistake.&nbsp; Besides the natural growth and decay of trees, a 
hundred other causes are ever at work to affect their structure 
and appearance; and the facts of the landscape, thus continually 
altering, afford sufficient occupation for the eye and hand of 
the woodman.&nbsp; It was late in life that Mr. Gladstone took to
woodcutting.&nbsp; Tried first as an experiment, it answered so 
admirably the object of getting the most complete exercise in a 
short time that, though somewhat slackened of late, it has never 
been abandoned.&nbsp; His procedure is characteristic.&nbsp; No 
exercise is taken in the morning, save the daily walk to morning 
service but between 3 and 4 in the afternoon he sallies forth, 
axe on shoulder, accompanied by one or more of his sons.&nbsp; 
The scene of action reached, there is no pottering; the work 
begins at once, and is carried on with unflagging energy.&nbsp; 
Blow follows blow, delivered with that skill which his favourite 
author <a name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a" 
class="citation">[33a]</a> reminds us is of more value to the 
woodman than strength, together with a force and energy that soon
tells its tale on the tree</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span

<p><i>Conington&rsquo;s Translation</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the advanced age he has now attained, it can hardly be 
expected that Mr. Gladstone can very frequently indulge in what 
has been his favourite recreation for the past twenty-five 
years.&nbsp; The present winter <a name="citation34"></a><a 
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a> however saw the fall
of at least one large tree, in which he took a full share&mdash;a
Spanish chestnut, measuring 10ft. at the top of the face, and 
those who were present can testify to the undiminished vigour 
with which the axe was wielded on that occasion.</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>Parish and District of Hawarden.</h2>
<p>The Parish of Hawarden is a very extensive one, containing 
upwards of 17,000 acres, with a population, according to the 
census of 1871, of 7088.&nbsp; Sixteen townships are included in 
it; Hawarden, Broadlane, Mancot Aston, Shotton, Pentrobin, Moor, 
Rake, Manor, Bannel, Bretton, Broughton, Ewloe Wood, Ewloe Town, 
Saltney and Sealand.&nbsp; To provide for the spiritual wants of 
so large a district, four daughter churches have been 
built&mdash;viz.: S. Matthew&rsquo;s, Buckley, <a 
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a" 
class="citation">[35a]</a> in 1822, S. Mary&rsquo;s, Broughton, 
<a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b" 
class="citation">[35b]</a> in 1824, S. Johns, Penymynydd, <a 
name="citation35c"></a><a href="#footnote35c" 
class="citation">[35c]</a> in 1843, and S. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, 
Sealand, in 1867.&nbsp; The work of the Parish Church is now 
further supplemented by three new School-chapels at Shotton, 
Sandycroft and Ewloe.&nbsp; The chief portion of Saltney, and the
district of Buckley, have been recently separated from Hawarden 
for ecclesiastical purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p35b.jpg">
<img alt="Lodge Gate&mdash;Broughton Approach" 
src="images/p35s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Rector of Hawarden has also to provide for the management 
and support of eight National Schools, involving <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>an 
annual expenditure of &pound;1460.&nbsp; The requirements of the 
Education Act of 1870 involved an outlay of &pound;4300 raised 
entirely from local sources.</p>
<p>The patronage of the living is vested in the Lord of the 
Manor. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36" 
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; The Rev. S. E. Gladstone, the 
present Rector, was appointed by the late Sir Stephen Glynne in 
1872.</p>
<p>The Grammar School is finely situated, near the Church, and 
has accommodation for 50 scholars, inclusive of 20 
boarders.&nbsp; The income from endowment is &pound;24.</p>
<p>The temporary building adjoining contains a portion of the 
Library of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone.</p>
<p>The land about Hawarden varies much in quality.&nbsp; The best
lies towards the river and on Saltney, where are large and well 
cultivated farms.&nbsp; On the higher ground in Pentrobin the 
soil is poorer; here however are found holdings that have 
remained in the same family for generations.&nbsp; The land is 
mainly arable; but little cheese being now made.</p>
<p>About one mile and a half from Hawarden on the road to 
Northop, lie ensconced in a wood the scant remains of the old 
Castle of Ewloe&mdash;the scene of a battle between the English 
and Welsh in 1157, in which the former were defeated by David and
Conan, sons of Owen Gwynedd.</p>
<p>The district is rich in beds of coal and clay.&nbsp; The 
former have been worked from an early period when the coal was 
mostly sent to Chester; but the difficulties of carriage before 
the turnpike road was made, and especially of draining the mines,
which before steam-engines came into use was attempted to be done
by means of <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>levels, <a name="citation37"></a><a 
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a> were a serious 
impediment to that development which under more favourable 
conditions has since taken place.</p>
<p>Formerly the only means of getting the minerals of the 
district away, was a horse tramway from Buckley to 
Queensferry.&nbsp; In 1862 however was opened the Wrexham and 
Connah&rsquo;s Quay Railway,&mdash;Mrs. Gladstone cutting the 
first sod, and an address from the Corporation of Wrexham being 
at the same time presented to Mr. Gladstone, then Chancellor of 
the Exchequer.&nbsp; This line is now carried through Hawarden, 
and, when connected with Birkenhead and Liverpool by the Mersey 
Tunnel, now happily completed, is destined in all probability to 
become one of importance beyond the limits of the immediate 
district.</p>
<p>Clay has been extensively worked in Buckley, where the Messrs.
Hancock&rsquo;s famous fire-brick is made.&nbsp; Mention may also
be made of the white bricks made by the Aston Hall Coal and Brick
Company, which are in great favour with builders on account of 
their powers of resisting the weather and of retaining their 
colour.&nbsp; A clay, resembling <i>terra cotta</i> when burnt, 
has also been found on Saltney.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>At Sandycroft, on the river bank, are the Ironworks 
belonging to Messrs. Taylor, where mining and other machinery is 
made.</p>
<p>The present course of the River below Chester, is called the 
New Cut, and was completed under Act of Parliament, in 1737, by 
the River Dee Company, who have lately handed over their interest
in the River to a newly formed Conservancy Board.&nbsp; The 
River, which before wandered over a large tract, was thus 
confined to the present channel, and a large reclamation of land 
effected.&nbsp; In compensation for the loss of rights of 
pasturage, &pound;200 is paid yearly by the Company to Trustees 
for the benefit of the Freeholders of the Manor of Hawarden; 
&pound;50 is also paid yearly for the repair of the south 
bank.&nbsp; This was followed by the inclosure of Saltney Marsh, 
in 1778.</p>
<p>Possessing as it does a greater depth of water over the bar 
than the Mersey, and provided with ample railway communication 
with the great industrial centres, it is probable that the Dee 
may ere long become a far more important river as a vehicle of 
commerce than heretofore.&nbsp; Of still more importance to 
Hawarden is the establishment of direct communication with 
Liverpool already referred to, in place of the present circuitous
route by Chester and Runcorn.&nbsp; By the new Swing Railway 
Bridge across the Dee, direct access will be given to Birkenhead 
and Liverpool by the Mersey Tunnel across the Wirral; such 
communication will not only stimulate and develop to the utmost 
the natural resources of the district, but will offer residential
facilities, beneficial, as it may be hoped, alike to town and 
country.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
